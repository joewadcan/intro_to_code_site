# Work Better With Devs

**Simply put, this course helps non-technical folks work better with developers.** 

By learning how programmers work, you will get a real tangible understanding of code and the realities of the software industry. Students are taught industry standard vocabulary, tools, and processes used by developers today. This is an introductory course, so we focus on breadth instead of depth. This allows us to cover more topics and a foundation for learning the topics critical to a career in technology.

:tada: **The course is for non-technical students with no prior coding experience**

:wave: Hello I'm Joe Wadcan! I've  taught this course at UC Berkeley for five years, as one of the most popular courses at the Haas School of Business. Currently I'm the co-founder of Bevy Inc. but most recently was the Head of Business Development at GitHub - the world's largest platform for software developers. Previously, I worked at Javelin Ventures and Citigroup, before having earned my MBA from Berkeley-Haas in 2012. I'm a self-taught programmer, I acutely understand the hardship, strategy, and shortcuts to coding from a beginner's mindset.

## Testimonials

Over the 5 years I've been teaching this class, I'm proud to have heard it's made an impact on people's careers. Here's a few choice messages I've been sent by folks who've taken my course in the past:

> "I just joined SendGrid and am convinced that the fact that I took your coding class gave me an edge in getting this job -- so thank you!" - Matt (Fall 13)

> "Loved the class! Literally everything we went over tonight was relevant for my job." - Ray (Spring 2013)

> "I'm not in a technical role but super helpful base that I've used to learn more and be able to add value as a PM. All that to say, thanks for all your help!" - Eduardo (Fall 14)

> "Hi Joe! I'm proud to say that the Intro the Code class has made a significant difference for me during my summer internship last year and now full-time. I'm now a Branch International, a microfinance startup - thanks so much!" - Sarah (Spring 16)

> "I am working over the summer as a product manager for the first time at Walmart Ecommerce and your intro to code class was everything that I needed to start with the right foot and gain respect from engineering!”  - Gabriela (Fall 17)

> "I'm now in my third day at Mux, and just wanted to let you know that I am soooo glad that I took your course. 😀 About 80% of my new intro to code vocab has already been mentioned or discussed! Without the course I might have been the dumbest intern ever... Thanks!" - Scarlett (Fall 2018)
