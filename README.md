# Work Better With Devs

**Simply put, this course helps non-technical folks work better with developers and engineering teams.** 

It can be tough joining a tech company and not feeling confident in your understanding of code. If you've bookmarked a dozen "learn to code" websites but just haven't been able to complete one... this is the course for you! 

In this course, we cover all the basics you'll need to feel confident working with developers. You'll be taught the industry standard vocabulary, tools, and processes used by developers today. Don't worry, this is an introductory course, so we intentionally go slowly, defining the core of each concept. Most "learn to code" tutorials assume you want to be a programmer, which is a nice idea, but this course is made for folks who just want to work a bit smarter. 

If you work at a large tech company or a small startup - you'll come away with a solid understanding of code and how developers work ... all while eating dinner once a week! :school_satchel::taco::computer::sparkles:

:tada: **The course is made for non-technical students with no prior coding experience**

:wave: Hello I'm Joe Wadcan! I've taught this course at UC Berkeley for five years, and it's one of the most popular courses at the Haas School of Business. I'm a self taught programmer, so I definitely know the struggle of learning to code from a non-technical point of view. Previously, I was the Head of Business Development at GitHub - the world's largest platform for software developers. And before that worked at Javelin Ventures, Citigroup, and a number of small startups.

## Class topics

- **Class 1** _(Jul 18 @ 6pm)_: **Vocab** = Learn basic developer concepts and terminology.
- **Class 2** _(Jul 25 @ 6pm)_: **CS001** = Learn the building blocks of a coding language.
- **Class 3** _(Aug 01 @ 6pm)_: **Tools** = Learn standard tools & platforms (Git & GitHub).
- **Class 4** _(Aug 08 @ 6pm)_: **Databases** = Learn how data is stored and structured.
- **Class 5** _(Aug 15 @ 6pm)_: **Testing** = Learn how code is tested and deployed.
- **Class 6** _(Aug 22 @ 6pm)_: **APIs** = Learn how applications are interconnected.
- **Class 7** _(Aug 29 @ 6pm)_: **Mobile** = Learn about mobile development.

## Class Format:

- **2 hours per class**
- 15 min: Go over weekly quiz results, questions from last week and session goals.
- 90 min: Introduce the new topic for the week with in-depth Q&A.
- 15 min: Discuss new industry trends and upcoming assignments.

The course will be a mixture of in-class lectures, quizzes, readings, and online tutorials. Each session introduces a new topic, with depth added in readings and reinforced through quizzes and assignments. The material is introduced cumulatively and the pace is specifically tuned for beginners. There is no online recording available, students are expected to come in-person to attend each class. 

## Grading

Students can choose to take the course with grades (some companies may require it). If you opt-in to grading, here is the basis for your grade:

- 42% = Participation via real-time trivia. 7 classes, 6% earned each class.
- 30% = Take home quizzes based on readings. 6 quizzes, 5% earned each quiz.
- 28% = Assignments show applied knowledge. 4 assignments, grade values vary.
- **100% = Participation + Quizzes + Assignments**

Instead of grading, I can also provide a certificate of completion if the student attends 6 of the 7 classes. 

## Testimonials

Over the 5 years I've been teaching this class, I'm proud to have heard it's made an impact on people's careers. Here's a few choice messages I've been sent by folks who've taken my course in the past:

> "I just joined SendGrid and am convinced that the fact that I took your coding class gave me an edge in getting this job -- so thank you!" - Matt (Fall 13)

> "Loved the class! Literally everything we went over tonight was relevant for my job." - Ray (Spring 2013)

> "I'm not in a technical role but super helpful base that I've used to learn more and be able to add value as a PM. All that to say, thanks for all your help!" - Eduardo (Fall 14)

> "Hi Joe! I'm proud to say that the Intro the Code class has made a significant difference for me during my summer internship last year and now full-time. I'm now a Branch International, a microfinance startup - thanks so much!" - Sarah (Spring 16)

> "I am working over the summer as a product manager for the first time at Walmart Ecommerce and your intro to code class was everything that I needed to start with the right foot and gain respect from engineering!”  - Gabriela (Fall 17)

> "I'm now in my third day at Mux, and just wanted to let you know that I am soooo glad that I took your course. 😀 About 80% of my new intro to code vocab has already been mentioned or discussed! Without the course I might have been the dumbest intern ever... Thanks!" - Scarlett (Fall 2018)
